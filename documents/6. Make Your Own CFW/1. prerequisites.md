# i. Prerequisites

Vector's software is complex and monstrous.

## Technical requirements

- A beefy Linux x86_64 computer.
    -   For reference, my desktop has:
        -   Ryzen 5 5700X3D
        -   32GB 3200MHz RAM
    -   For a comfortable experience, you should have at least 16GB of RAM.
- A Vector.
    -   You'll need something to test your code on.
    -   Preferably, you should have a 1.0 and a 2.0.
- `git`, `docker`, `wget`
    -   Everything is done in Docker. Don't worry, the build scripts initiate Docker automatically.

## Human requirements

- Smarts
    -   You need experience with C++. Lots of it.
    -   Don't be dependent on LLMs to help you. It won't be able to in lots of cases.
- Activity
    -   You have to be active. You should keep syncing the changes of WireOS into your OS, take care of user requests/bug reports, etc.
- Exigence
    -   Do you actually need to create a whole new CFW with its own name and possibly GitHub org, or do you just want to make a couple OTAs to show off a feature you created?
