# How to Develop

Here, we will perform two steps in one: learning how to make modifications to the code, and how to change the final screen in CCIS which describes what the builds are.

## What IDE should I use?

Anki tended to use Visual Studio Code - just use that.

## What OS should I use?

An M-series Macs, or an x86_64 Linux PC - toolchains are only available for these platforms.

## Let's make a modification!

1. Open up the diode-os-victor folder in VSCode.
2. Open up `animProcess/src/cozmoAnim/faceDisplay/faceInfoScreenManager.cpp`
3. Modify lines 69-72 to match the details of your new CFW.
4. Open a terminal and run `cd ~/diode-os-victor`
5. Build the code by running this: `./build/build-v.sh`

## Deploy

When you deploy code to a robot, his /anki folder gets replaced. This can be done on a laptop (reference: Ryzen 7840U, 16GB RAM). You do not need to build a whole OTA every time you want to test a change. ./build/build.sh just builds a /anki folder.

1. Open a terminal and `cd ~/diode-os-victor`
2. Echo your robot's IP address to robot_ip.txt: `echo "192.168.1.50" > robot_ip.txt`
3. Run: `curl -o robot_sshkey https://github.com/kercre123/unlocking-vector/raw/refs/heads/main/ssh_root_key`
4. Deploy: `./build/deploy-v.sh`

## Build an OTA with your change

1. Run `cd ~/diode-os`
2. Update the submodule: 
```bash
cd anki/victor
git pull origin main
cd ../../
git add .
git commit -m "vp"
git push
```
3. Build:
```bash
./build/build.sh -bt dev -v 1
```
4. Your OTA will be at: ./_build/vicos-3.0.1.1d.ota.
