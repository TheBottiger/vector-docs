# Partitions

Vector's partition table is pretty similar to that of an Android phone, except he has a couple extra ones added by Anki.

## OEM

## EMR

The EMR partiton (Electronic Medical Record) contains the calibration info of the robot as well as it's ESN.

## boot_a and boot_b

These are the boot partitions. These partitons contain a ramdisk which is loaded which will then load a system partition matching the slot ID you are in.

## system_a and system_b
