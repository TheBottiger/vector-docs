Guidelines you should follow.

## Correctness

Double-check everything you type. It must be grammatically correct and everything should be spelled correctly.

## Understandability

For example, if you are writing instructions, read it over under the mindset of a user. Are you able to understand it? Would someone who isn't super technically-inclined understand it?
