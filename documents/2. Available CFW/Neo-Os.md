Neo-Os was created and developed by [The-Bottiger](https://github.com/TheBottiger) if you want to check it out here [Neo-Os](https://github.com/TheBottiger/Neo-OS-oelinux) it would be a
pleasure if you try it!


# What does it does and what is the sole purpose?

Neo-Os is an Matrix look alike experience via appearance based on [Wire-OS](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os), alongisde with a Matrix Rampotst and Boot Animation and the purpose of making this OS is
making other people happy and productive.

# My Experience and how I decided to work on this project

Ever since my parents gifted me an anki vector for christmas 2021 I was always interested how it works and how its os is capable of doing things
later throughout the year I learned a little bit of C and C++ but the rest I was most knowledgable in assembly code. Now where am I to this day? I'm probably 
still at Highschool learning or maybe working on the next future Neo-Os update most of the time im either at my computer desk and likely to be mostly active.
